    Heuristic
    
*   [Doherty Threshold](/doherty-threshold/)

    Principle

    Heuristic
    
*   [Hick’s Law](/hicks-law/)
    -------------------------
    
    The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.
    
    Heuristic
    
*   [Jakob’s Law](/jakobs-law/)
    ---------------------------
    
    Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.
    
    Heuristic
    
*   [Law of Common Region](/law-of-common-region/)
    ----------------------------------------------
    
    Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary.
    
    Gestalt
    
*   [Law of Proximity](/law-of-proximity/)
    --------------------------------------
    
    Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.
    
    Gestalt
    
*   [Law of Prägnanz](/law-of-pr%C3%A4gnanz/)
    -----------------------------------------
    
    People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it is the interpretation that requires the least cognitive effort of us.
    
    Gestalt
    
*   [Law of Similarity](/law-of-similarity/)
    ----------------------------------------
    
    The human eye tends to perceive similar elements in a design as a complete picture, shape, or group, even if those elements are separated.
    
    Gestalt
    
*   [Law of Uniform Connectedness](/law-of-uniform-connectedness/)
    --------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection.
    
    Gestalt
    
*   [Miller’s Law](/millers-law/)
    -----------------------------
    
    The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.
    
    Heuristic
    
*   [Occam’s Razor](/occams-razor/)
    -------------------------------
    
    Among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.
    
    Principle
    
*   [Pareto Principle](/pareto-principle/)
    --------------------------------------
    
    The Pareto principle states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
    
    Principle
    
*   [Parkinson’s Law](/parkinsons-law/)
    -----------------------------------
    
    Any task will inflate until all of the available time is spent.
    
    Heuristic
    
*   [Peak-End Rule](/peak-end-rule/)
    --------------------------------
    
    People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.
    
    Cognitive Bias
    
*   [Postel’s Law](/postels-law/)
    -----------------------------
    
    Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.
    
    Principle
    
*   [Serial Position Effect](/serial-position-effect/)
    --------------------------------------------------
    
    Users have a propensity to best remember the first and last items in a series.
    
    Cognitive Bias
    
*   [Tesler’s Law](/teslers-law/)
    -----------------------------
    
    Tesler's Law, also known as The Law of Conservation of Complexity, states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced.
    
    Principle
    
*   [Von Restorff Effect](/von-restorff-effect/)
    --------------------------------------------
    
    The Von Restorff effect, also known as The Isolation Effect, predicts that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.
    
    Cognitive Bias
    
*   [Zeigarnik Effect](/zeigarnik-effect/)
    --------------------------------------
    
    People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.

Zeigarnik Effect
================

Overview
--------

People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.

Takeaways
---------

1.  Invite content discovery by providing clear signifiers of additional content.
2.  Providing artificial progress towards a goal will help to ensure users are more likely to have the motivation to complete that task.
3.  Provide a clear indication of progress in order to motivate users to complete tasks.

Origins
-------

Bluma Wulfovna Zeigarnik (1900 – 1988) was a Soviet psychologist and psychiatrist, a member of the Berlin School of experimental psychology and Vygotsky Circle. She discovered the Zeigarnik effect and contributed to the establishment of experimental psychopathology as a separate discipline in the Soviet Union in the post-World War II period. In the 1920s she conducted a study on memory, in which she compared memory in relation to incomplete and complete tasks. She had found that incomplete tasks are easier to remember than successful ones. This is now known as the Zeigarnik effect. She later began working at the Institute of Higher Nervous Activity which is where she would meet her next big influence Vygowski, and become a part of his circle of scientists. It was also there that Zeigarnik founded the Department of Psychology. During that time, Zeigarnik received the Lewin Memorial Award in 1983 for her psychological research.
